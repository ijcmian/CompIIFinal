# CompIIFinal
The original purpose of this project was to be a space invaders esque game, with multiple enemy types and levels to progress through.
The people who worked on this project was I and Aaron Occhipinti 

I feel as if I learned the most about what it is like to code as a team, as before all our assignments were done on our own or with a 
little help from others. It was interesting and fun to work on something from scratch. I also learned a lot more about the basics of 
generics and interfaces, as working with them while on the computer made much more sense than reading about them. Also I had zero work
done in JavafX before this project and learned how to use that pretty well by the end of the project.

We ran into quite a few problems. Probably the most glaring being the fact we never found a way to spawn the enemies quiet like I wanted 
to. Instead as you can tell in the code, each enemy is created in one instance. We tried many different ways to figure it out but none 
would seem to work sadly enough. After enough time hung up on it we decided to scrap what we had from it and start a new with the enemy
class, and got something working at the very least.

And honestly, we had a good amount left to do before the deadline. We never got to adding the sprites to the enemy hitbox's for one. We 
planned on trying to add different enemy types, and more fleshed out levels that got harder and harder. We thought about the idea of power
ups but clearly never got there. We could never get the "HighScore" page working with saving highscores and the like from the player. It's
pretty safe to say we bit off more than we could chew on this one, but at least I have something to work on over the summer now!
